The commandis to add a usser is:
	-> sudo useradd <name_user>
	-> sudo adduser <name_user>

It can be checked with the command of the previous exercise.
The second command ask for some extra information (Full Name, Room Number...).
The interesting part is that with the second one, we're asked to paswword,
so we can change the user to the one created using [su <name_user>].
