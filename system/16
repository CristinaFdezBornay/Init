The command that should be ued to schedule task is [crontab].
If the flag [-e] is added we can edit the commands that are alredeady scheduled.
The syntax should be:
	-> * * * * * <process>


The starts represent different date parts in the following order:
	1)	minute (from 0 to 59)
	2)	hour (from 0 to 23)
	3)	day of month (from 1 to 31)
	4)	month (from 1 to 12)
	5)	day of week (from 0 to 6) (0=Sunday)
The stars can also replaced by some useful keywords:
	-	@reboot     Run once, at startup
	-	@yearly     Run once  a year     "0 0 1 1 *"
	-	@annually   (same as  @yearly)
	-	@monthly    Run once  a month    "0 0 1 * *"
	-	@weekly     Run once  a week     "0 0 * * 0"
	-	@daily      Run once  a day      "0 0 * * *"
	-	@midnight   (same as  @daily)
	-	@hourly     Run once  an hour    "0 * * * *"

The command [crontab] also allows to send the output by mail, store it and delete it.
