/*
	When I try to execute the command hostname on my VM:

		-> hostname: you must be root to change the host name

	For getting root permission the command to execute is [su],
	then the root pasword should be introduced [Cristina.1996].
	After that we can change the hostname by modifying the /etc/hostname file
	and reboot the system [sudo reboot] to make it permanent.
