	-> lsblk
	-> sudo fdisk -l
	-> sudo sfdisk -l /dev/sda

The [lsblk] command lists all the block devices of your system along with their logical partitions.

The [fdisk] command is used to create, format or delete hard disk partitions. 
Here we will use it to list the partitions table by using a particular flag with it.

The [sfdisk] command is primarily used to manipulate partition tables on Linux.
It can also be used to list the partitions tables of a device by using the following syntax: 
	[sudo sfdisk -l/dev/devicename]
